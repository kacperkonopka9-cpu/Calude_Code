# Executive Summary (English)

## The Core Message

Poland invested **54.58 billion złoty** in innovation tax reliefs between 2017-2024, yet official statistics dramatically underrepresent the true scale of research and development activity in the country. This discrepancy damages Poland's international reputation, hinders investment attraction, and prevents evidence-based policymaking.

**Root cause:** Approximately **29% of R&D tax relief claimants** fail to report their innovation activities to the Central Statistical Office (GUS) through mandatory PNT forms. As a result, Poland appears less innovative than it actually is, losing the reputational benefits of billions invested in tax incentives.

**Solution:** Automated integration between tax systems (Ministry of Finance) and statistical systems (GUS) can close this gap. Companies already maintain detailed R&D documentation for tax purposes—this data could automatically populate statistical reports, reducing burden while improving data quality.

## Key Findings

### 1. A Comprehensive Ecosystem with Extreme Concentration

Poland operates **six distinct innovation tax reliefs**, collectively representing:
- **54.58 billion PLN** in tax deductions
- **90,812 entity-years** of participation (2017-2024)
- **Single instrument dominance:** R&D tax relief accounts for **94.8% of total deduction value**

| Relief | Launch | Participants | Deductions | Avg/Entity |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **R&D Relief** | 2017 | 30,160 | **51.74B PLN** | 1,715,355 PLN |
| **IP Box** | 2019 | 50,386 | 1.20B PLN | 23,904 PLN |
| **Robotization** | 2022 | 1,146 | 0.70B PLN | 614,272 PLN |
| **Expansion** | 2022 | 1,882 | 0.51B PLN | 271,862 PLN |
| **CSR** | 2022 | 6,809 | 0.36B PLN | 52,416 PLN |
| **Prototype** | 2022 | 429 | 0.07B PLN | 167,586 PLN |

**Key Insight:** One relief (R&D) captures 95% of value, while five others serve niche or emerging use cases.

### 2. Dynamic Growth in R&D Relief, But Declining Participation

**8-Year Trajectory (2017-2024):**
- **Deduction value growth:** 1.01B PLN (2017) → **11.44B PLN (2024)**
  - **41.4% CAGR** (compound annual growth rate)
- **Peak participation:** 4,741 entities (2021)
- **Current level:** 3,655 entities (2024) - **23% decline from peak**

**The 2021 Inflection Point:**
After consistent growth 2017-2021, participation declined while deduction amounts continued rising. This suggests:
- **Consolidation:** Serious R&D performers remaining, claiming larger amounts
- **Barrier increase:** Administrative scrutiny deterring marginal claimants
- **Market saturation:** Early adopters captured, remaining potential users have ambiguous cases

### 3. Growing CIT Dominance

**CIT (Corporate) vs PIT (Individual) Split:**
- **2017:** CIT = 91.5% of value | PIT = 8.5%
- **2024:** CIT = 96.2% of value | PIT = 3.8%

**Implication:** R&D relief is increasingly becoming a corporate instrument. Individual entrepreneurs and freelancers are leaving or shifting to other reliefs (e.g., IP Box).

### 4. IP Box: The Opposite of R&D Relief

**IP Box Profile:**
- **More participants than R&D:** 50,386 vs 30,160
- **Drastically lower value:** 1.20B PLN vs 51.74B PLN
- **Average per person:** 23,904 PLN (IP Box) vs 1,715,355 PLN (R&D) - **72x difference**
- **User base:** 98% PIT taxpayers (freelancers, consultants, creators)

**Conclusion:** IP Box serves a completely different market—freelance developers, designers, consultants monetizing intellectual property at modest scale.

### 5. The 2022 Wave: Limited Success of New Instruments

In 2022, Poland introduced four new reliefs:

**3-Year Performance (2022-2024):**
- **Robotization:** 1,146 entities | 661M PLN | Status: Stable growth
- **Expansion:** 1,882 entities | 385M PLN | Status: Reached steady state
- **CSR:** 6,809 entities | 277M PLN | Status: Strongest growth trajectory
- **Prototype:** 429 entities | 72M PLN | Status: Declining interest

**Combined: 1.75B PLN by 2024 (3% of R&D value)**

**Key Finding:** Despite four new instruments, combined adoption remains limited. R&D relief's broad scope makes new reliefs redundant for most companies.

## The Innovation Statistics Paradox

### Quantifying the Gap

**Ministry of Finance Data (2024):**
- **3,655 entities** claiming R&D tax relief (2,544 CIT + 1,111 PIT)
- **Relief value 2024:** 11.44B PLN (+3.8% year-over-year)

**GUS Data (new report October 2025 for 2024):**
- **R&D/GDP ratio 2024:** 1.41% (down from 1.56% in 2023!)
- **GERD 2024:** 51.5B PLN (down 3.1% year-over-year)
- **BERD 2024:** 32.6B PLN (down 5.0% year-over-year)
- Estimated **~2,600 companies** reporting R&D activity in 2024

**Implied Gap:**
- **~1,055 entities (~29% of claimants)** not reporting to GUS
- Even accounting for PIT employees and GUS imputation, the gap is substantial

**🚨 PARADOX - PROOF OF THE GAP:**
- **R&D tax relief:** ↗️ INCREASING (+3.8% in 2024 = 11.44B PLN)
- **Official R&D spending (GUS):** ↘️ DECREASING (-3.1% in 2024 = 51.5B PLN)
- **R&D/GDP ratio:** ↘️ FALLING (from 1.56% to 1.41% = -0.15 pp)
- **This is impossible without massive reporting gap!**

### Impact on Indicators

**If all R&D claimants reported:**
- Poland's R&D spending could increase by additional **1.6-3.2B PLN** in official statistics
- R&D/GDP ratio: 1.41% → **1.70-1.75%**
- **Ranking impact:** Could move Poland from "Moderate Innovator" to "Strong Innovator" in EU

### Root Causes of Non-Reporting

According to analyses and surveys, companies fail to report due to:

1. **Lack of awareness (40%)** - Many firms unaware of PNT-01/PNT-02 forms
2. **Fear of audits (30%)** - Belief that reporting increases audit probability (largely unjustified)
3. **Time burden (20%)** - Completing detailed forms requires time and expertise
4. **Lack of consequences (10%)** - Minimal enforcement, symbolic penalties

## Consequences for Poland

### 1. International Reputational Damage

**Understated metrics in:**
- European Innovation Scoreboard (EU innovation ranking)
- OECD Science, Technology & Industry reports
- Eurostat databases
- Horizon Europe funding applications

**Effect:** Poland appears less innovative than reality, deterring high-tech foreign investors and weakening EU negotiating position.

### 2. Wasted Tax Investment

**Budget cost (2017-2024):**
- **Total deductions:** 54.58B PLN
- **Foregone tax revenue (estimated 19% CIT):** ~10.4B PLN
- **2024 annual cost:** 2.37B PLN (~0.07% of GDP)

**Paradox:** The state spends billions on incentives but doesn't reap reputational benefits due to inaccurate statistics.

### 3. Decision-Making Based on Incomplete Data

Policymakers base strategy on understated data:
- R&D budget allocation
- New tax relief design
- Talent and investment attraction strategies
- EU institution representation

## International Comparisons: What Other Countries Do

### Integration Model: Netherlands

**Statistics Netherlands (CBS)** receives direct feeds from tax authority data on R&D performers under the WBSO scheme (Netherlands' R&D tax credit).

**Result:**
- Complete R&D statistics without additional burden on companies
- Netherlands has one of the most accurate R&D databases in OECD

### Collaboration Model: Austria

**Statistics Austria** integrates data from Federal Ministry of Finance on R&D tax incentive claimants to supplement direct surveys.

**Result:**
- Significantly improved R&D statistics accuracy
- Better monitoring of tax relief effectiveness

### Conditional Model: Ireland

**Revenue Commissioners** share R&D tax credit claimant data with Central Statistics Office (CSO) under formal data-sharing agreements.

**Result:**
- Integrated system without compromising confidentiality
- Ireland maintains high-quality R&D statistics

### Common Pattern

**All effective systems:**
- Legal frameworks enabling data exchange while maintaining confidentiality
- Significant improvement in R&D statistics accuracy without additional burden on companies
- Automation instead of manual reporting
