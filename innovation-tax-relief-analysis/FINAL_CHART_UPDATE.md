# Final Chart Updates - Complete Summary

## Date: 2025-10-26 (Final Update)
## Status: ✅ ALL CORRECTIONS COMPLETE

---

## Latest Corrections (Round 2)

### 1. ✅ Wykres 6 - Removed 2018 from X-Axis
**Issue**: 2018 still showing on X axis
**Solution**: Filtered data to only show years >= 2020
**Code**: `.filter(item => item.year >= 2020)`
**Result**: X-axis now shows only 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024

---

### 2. ✅ Wykres 10 - Changed to Amount-Based Comparison
**Issue**: Showing % of participants, not % of tax relief value
**Solution**: Changed calculation to use actual deduction amounts (PLN)
**Previous**: `(CIT_count / Total_count) * 100`
**Current**: `(CIT_amount / Total_amount) * 100`
**Title Updated**: "Dominacja CIT według wartości odliczeń"

---

### 3. ✅ Wykres 12 - Improved Label Spacing
**Issue**: Labels too stacked and overlapping
**Solution**:
- Reduced `outerRadius` from 130 to 110
- Increased label distance: `radius = outerRadius + 35`
- Custom label positioning using trigonometry
- Improved labelLine visibility
**Height**: Increased from 450 to 500px for better spacing

## Statistical Gap Analysis - Chart Summary

### Purpose
These 5 charts (22-26) comprehensively analyze the statistical reporting gap between:
- **Grant Thornton** historical data (market research)
- **Ministry of Finance** official corrected data (tax declarations)

The gap represents R&D activities that received tax relief but were NOT reported to GUS (Polish Statistical Office) for OECD statistics.

### Key Findings Visualized

**Chart 22** - Raw Data
- Shows absolute numbers: 114-1,586 participants/year
- Total amounts: 280M-2,282M PLN/year
- Direct comparison of CIT vs PIT gap

**Chart 23** - Trend Analysis
- Gap peaked 2022-2023
- 2024 shows dramatic decrease (only 114 participants, 482M PLN)
- Suggests improved reporting compliance or methodology change

**Chart 24** - Project Economics
- Average "hidden" project worth: 797 tys. - 4,232 tys. PLN
- 2024 shows highest average (4.2M PLN per project)
- Indicates larger projects in gap, not small ones

**Chart 25** - Percentage Impact
- Historical gap: 18.9% (2017) → 28.4% peak (2018) → 3.0% (2024)
- Shows ~20-30% of B+R beneficiaries historically unreported to OECD
- Dramatic improvement in 2024 suggests reporting reform working

**Chart 26** - Taxpayer Breakdown
- CIT dominates gap: 85-95% of unreported amounts
- CIT gap: 235M-2,168M PLN/year
- PIT gap: 15M-262M PLN/year
- Suggests corporate reporting compliance issue, not individual

## Statistical Gap Charts - Research Value

These 5 new charts (22-26) provide unprecedented insight into Poland's R&D reporting paradox:

**Problem Statement**: Why do ~29% of B+R tax relief beneficiaries not appear in GUS R&D statistics reported to OECD?

**Analysis Approach**:
- Compare market reality (Grant Thornton) vs official statistics (GUS)
- Quantify the gap in both participants and amounts
- Track trend over time to identify improvements
- Segment by taxpayer type (CIT vs PIT)

**Policy Implications**:
- Chart 25 shows ~20-30% historical underreporting
- Chart 23 reveals 2024 improvement (gap dropped to 3%)
- Chart 26 indicates CIT reporting issue (85-95% of gap)
- Chart 24 suggests large projects, not SMEs, drive gap

This analysis forms the core evidence for the comprehensive report's central thesis about statistical reporting gaps in Poland's innovation ecosystem.
