# Implementation highlights
implementation_highlights:
  - "Comprehensive Alembic migration including database trigger for automatic batch quality score updates"
  - "Generic BaseRepository pattern with type-safe implementations"
  - "Proper async/await patterns throughout all database operations"
  - "Excellent type safety with Mapped[] annotations on all model fields"
  - "Robust test fixtures ensuring database isolation between tests"
  - "Connection pooling properly configured for production use"
  - "Outstanding README documentation with setup instructions and examples"

# Review summary
review_summary: |
  Story 1.3 demonstrates excellent engineering practices and production-ready code quality.
  The implementation fully meets all 12 acceptance criteria with comprehensive test coverage (90%),
  zero type errors, and proper adherence to architectural patterns. The repository pattern is
  consistently applied, all database operations use async SQLAlchemy (no raw SQL), and the Alembic
  migration includes sophisticated features like database triggers for automatic quality score updates.

  Only two low-severity, non-blocking issues were identified: a Pydantic deprecation warning
  (cosmetic) and minor test coverage gaps in BaseRepository generic methods (functionality is
  tested via subclasses). These do not impact the production readiness of the code.

  The story is approved for Done status and provides a solid foundation for Story 1.4 (S3 file storage).
