# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **R&D Tax Relief Project Card Generator**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for this modern fullstack application where these concerns are tightly integrated through AI services and real-time batch processing.

## 1.1 Starter Template

**Decision:** N/A - Greenfield project

This is a greenfield project with a well-defined technology stack from the PRD and technology research report. No starter template will be used, allowing maximum flexibility for the specific requirements (AWS Bedrock integration, Celery batch processing, custom MUI theme, GDPR compliance).
