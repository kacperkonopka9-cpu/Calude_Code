# 20. Summary

This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for the R&D Tax Relief Project Card Generator. Key highlights:

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Modern tech stack (React 18, FastAPI, AWS)
- ✅ EU-compliant (GDPR, data residency)
- ✅ Resilient AI integration (primary + failover)
- ✅ Real-time batch processing (WebSocket)
- ✅ Comprehensive testing strategy
- ✅ Production-ready deployment pipeline

**Technology Decisions:**
- AWS-centric for simplicity (Bedrock requirement)
- Monorepo for type sharing (TypeScript across stack)
- Celery for async batch processing (proven pattern)
- React Query for server state (eliminates Redux)
- PostgreSQL JSONB for flexible content storage

**Next Steps:**
1. Run architecture validation checklist
2. Set up development environment
3. Execute AI generation POC (2 weeks)
4. Begin Sprint 0 (infrastructure setup)
5. Start Epic 1 development (Excel upload)

**Architecture Owner:** Winston (BMad Architect)
**Review Date:** 2025-10-22
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Development
