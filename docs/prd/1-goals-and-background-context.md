# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Product Goals

This product aims to deliver the following measurable outcomes:

1. **Reduce Manual Work Time**: Decrease project card generation time from 20-40 hours per batch to <5 hours total (including review/editing)
2. **Enable Batch Processing**: Support generation of 1-20 project cards from a single Excel file upload
3. **Achieve Quality Threshold**: Deliver ≥70% AI-generated content that requires ≤30% consultant editing to meet Ulga B+R standards
4. **Maintain Speed**: Generate individual project cards in ≤15 minutes (target: 1 minute average)
5. **Ensure Compliance**: Produce cards that comply with Polish R&D tax relief (Ulga B+R) requirements without legal risk
6. **Maximize Accessibility**: Achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for all users including tax consultants with varying technical skills
7. **Provide Transparency**: Display clear quality scores (0-100%) and highlight AI-generated vs. manual sections for consultant confidence

## 1.2 Background Context

Polish R&D tax consultants currently spend 20-40 hours manually creating batches of 10-20 project cards for clients applying for Ulga B+R (Research & Development tax relief). Each card requires detailed Polish-language descriptions of project goals, methodology, innovation, and R&D activities across 8-12 sections following strict government templates.

This manual process creates a business bottleneck: consultants who could handle strategic client relationships instead spend most of their time on repetitive document generation. The quality is inconsistent, deadlines are tight, and scaling the business requires hiring more expensive specialists.

Our solution leverages AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4) to automate 70%+ of the content generation while keeping consultants in control through a review/edit workflow. By providing structured Excel input templates and validating data upfront, we ensure AI receives the context needed to generate high-quality, compliant project cards that consultants can confidently submit after minimal editing.
