# 7. Next Steps & Handoff

This section defines the immediate next steps to move from product requirements to implementation.

## Immediate Actions (Week 1)

### 1. Architect Kickoff
**Owner**: System Architect
**Deliverable**: `docs/architecture.md`
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

**Architect Tasks**:
- Review PRD, UX spec, and technology research report
- Create system architecture document including:
  - High-level architecture diagram (frontend, backend, AI services, data layer)
  - Technology stack confirmation (React 18+, Python 3.11+, FastAPI, AWS services)
  - Database schema design (PostgreSQL tables, S3 storage structure)
  - API design (REST endpoints, request/response formats)
  - Authentication architecture (method selection and implementation)
  - Real-time update mechanism (WebSocket vs polling)
  - Deployment architecture (AWS ECS Fargate, Vercel, CloudFront)
  - CI/CD pipeline design (GitHub Actions workflow)
  - Monitoring and observability strategy (CloudWatch metrics, alerts)
  - Security architecture (TLS 1.3, encryption, GDPR compliance)
  - Coding standards and development practices
  - Source tree structure

**Architect Prompt**:
```
Create architecture document for R&D Tax Relief Project Card Generator based on:
- PRD: docs/prd.md
- Tech Research: docs/technology-research-report.md
- UX Spec: docs/front-end-spec.md
- Figma Design: docs/figma-design-specifications.md

Focus on:
1. System architecture for AWS + React + Python FastAPI + Claude/GPT-4
2. Database schema for PostgreSQL + S3 file storage
3. AI integration architecture (Bedrock + Azure OpenAI failover)
4. Real-time batch processing (Celery + Redis)
5. GDPR-compliant data lifecycle
6. Authentication method selection and implementation
```

### 2. Product Owner Validation
**Owner**: Product Owner
**Deliverable**: Master Checklist Report
**Timeline**: 1 week (after architecture complete)

**PO Tasks**:
- Run `/po` + master checklist to validate PRD + Architecture alignment
- Verify all requirements have architectural solutions
- Identify any gaps or inconsistencies
- Approve architecture or request refinements

### 3. Document Sharding (PO)
**Owner**: Product Owner
**Deliverable**: `docs/epics/*.md` and `docs/stories/*.md`
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

**PO Tasks**:
- Use `/po` + `/shard-doc` command to shard PRD into epic documents
- Use `/po` + `/shard-doc` command to shard Architecture into story documents
- Ensure each story has:
  - Clear user story format ("As a [persona], I want [goal] so that [benefit]")
  - Detailed acceptance criteria
  - References to architecture and coding standards
  - Test requirements
  - Dependencies on other stories

**Sharding Priority**:
1. Epic 1 (Excel Upload) - Shard first for immediate development start
2. Epic 8 (Authentication) - Can develop in parallel
3. Epic 2 (AI Generation) - Shard after POC validates approach
4. Remaining P0 epics (3, 4, 5)
5. P1 epics (6, 7, 9)

## Development Preparation (Weeks 2-4)

### 4. Story Grooming with Development Team
**Owner**: Scrum Master + Developer(s)
**Timeline**: 1 week (after sharding)

**SM Tasks**:
- Run `/sm` + create first story from Epic 1
- Groom stories with development team
- Size stories (story points or t-shirt sizes)
- Identify technical unknowns or spikes needed
- Sequence stories for first 3 sprints

### 5. AI Generation POC Sprint (CRITICAL)
**Owner**: Developer(s)
**Deliverable**: POC validation report
**Timeline**: 2 weeks (can run parallel to architecture)

**POC Goals** (from tech report Section 10.2):
- Build minimal prompt → AI → Word pipeline
- Test with 3-5 real example projects from brief.md
- Validate token costs with actual API calls (target: €0.80-1.50/doc)
- Confirm Polish language quality with native speaker
- Measure generation time (target: 1 min average, ≤15 min max)

**POC Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Generated cards rated ≥70% usable by consultant
- ✅ Cost within €0.80-1.50 per document
- ✅ No critical hallucinations (invented facts)
- ✅ Polish grammar acceptable to native speaker
- ✅ Generation time ≤15 minutes

**POC Failure Response**:
- If quality <70%: Refine prompts, try alternative models, adjust expectations
- If cost >€2.00: Optimize prompts, reduce example count, consider GPT-4 Turbo
- If hallucination critical: Strengthen grounding instructions, add fact-checking
- If time >20 min: Switch to GPT-4 Turbo (faster), optimize prompt length

### 6. Development Environment Setup
**Owner**: Developer(s) + DevOps (if available)
**Timeline**: 1 week

**Setup Tasks**:
- Clone repository, set up local development environment
- Install dependencies (Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Configure AWS accounts (Bedrock, S3, RDS, ECS)
- Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Create development, staging, production environments
- Configure secrets management (API keys, database credentials)
- Set up monitoring (CloudWatch dashboards)

## Sprint 0 (Week 5): Foundation Sprint

**Goals**:
- Complete all setup and scaffolding
- Validate development workflow (code → test → deploy)
- Establish quality gates (linting, tests, coverage)

**Sprint 0 Stories**:
1. Set up React 18 TypeScript project with Vite and Material-UI
2. Set up Python FastAPI backend with project structure
3. Configure PostgreSQL database with initial schema
4. Set up S3 file storage with lifecycle policies
5. Implement CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
