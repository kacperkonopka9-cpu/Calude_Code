## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Native speaker not available

**Probability:** Low (10%)
**Impact:** High (POC incomplete)
**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Have backup candidate ready (2nd choice from interviews)
- [ ] Consider extending deadline by 2-3 days if needed

### Risk 2: API costs exceed budget

**Probability:** Very Low (5%)
**Impact:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Monitor costs after first 3 generations
- [ ] Reduce few-shot examples if needed (2 → 1)
- [ ] Stop testing if costs spike unexpectedly

### Risk 3: Quality significantly below threshold

**Probability:** Medium (30%)
**Impact:** Medium (requires pivot)
**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Have prompt refinement plan ready
- [ ] Identify specific failure patterns
- [ ] Budget +1 week for iteration

### Risk 4: Technical failures (API, code bugs)

**Probability:** Low (15%)
**Impact:** Medium (delays testing)
**Mitigation:**
- [ ] Test with 1 case before full run
- [ ] Have error handling in generate.py
- [ ] Budget 1 extra day for troubleshooting
